This needs Vundle in ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
  `git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`
  For the first launch of vim, you need to do :VundleInstall to get all the modules installed.

For the YouCompleteMe module, install the native bindings:
from the ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe directory.
  `./install.py --clang-completer --gocode-completer`

flake8 needs to be installed for python flake8 testing
  `apt install flake8`
